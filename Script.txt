Good Afternoon,


I’m Dnyaneswhar Koradiya, and I'm excited to share some insights about your business. Thank you for
providing the guiding questions. It was helpful to see what insights you want to
gain from the data. I hope you find the analysis compelling and helpful as you make decisions
regarding future business opportunities.﻿

First off, I want to assure you that I’ve provided the most up-to-date and error-free analysis. After
I loaded the data into my software to scrub any records that had negative quantities and
unit price, as these records needed to be removed to provide helpful analysis.


﻿As for your first question, the CEO has requested a trend of the revenue to see if there is any
seasonality in the store sales. My analysis shows that there are some months of the year where
exceptional growth is witnessed. The revenue trends throughout the year show notable fluctuations. 
Starting in January at approximately $0.85 million, there is a slight dip in February to around 
$0.75 million. A significant increase occurs in April, peaking near $1 million, followed by a 
decline in May back to $0.75 million. The most substantial growth is observed in December, 
reaching a year-end high of around $1.5 million. These patterns indicate important periods of 
growth and decline, which can be crucial for making informed business decisions. 


The second visual shows how the top 10 countries that have growth opportunities are
performing. This data does not include the UK as the country already has high demand and I’ve
been told you’re more focused on the countries where demand can be increased.The revenue analysis reveals that the Netherlands and EIRE lead with the highest figures, both exceeding 280K, with the Netherlands slightly ahead at 285K. Germany and France follow with revenues of 229K and 210K, respectively. Australia, despite having a higher quantity (84K) than Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Japan, and Belgium, reports a relatively lower revenue of 139K compared to the top four countries. The latter group, including Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Japan, and Belgium, shows both lower quantities and revenues, with Sweden having the smallest gap between quantity and revenue among them.

The third analysis has been performed on the top 10 customers who have purchased the most
from the store. The data shows that there is not much of a difference between the purchases
made by the top 10 customers. The analysis highlights the top customers, with CustomerID 14646 generating the highest revenue at $350K, followed by CustomerID 18102 with $250K, and CustomerID 17450 with $200K. The visual representation arranges these bars in descending order of revenue, starting with the highest. This layout clearly shows the variability in revenue contributions across different CustomerIDs, with some customers contributing significantly more than others.

Finally, the map chart shows the regions that have generated the most revenue compared with
the regions that have not. It can be seen that apart from the UK, countries such as Netherlands,
Ireland, Germany, France, and Australia are generating high revenue and the company should
invest more in these areas to increase demand for products. The map also shows that most of
the sales are only in the European region with very few in the American region. Africa and Asia
do not have any demand for the products, along with Russia. A new strategy targeting these
areas has the potential to boost sales revenues and profitability.


Thanks so much for your time. If you have any questions about the analysis or would like to see
anything additional after you’ve had time to digest this information, I’d be happy to develop that
for you.
